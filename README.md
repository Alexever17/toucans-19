## Introdcution
Hy there stranger and welcome in our small learning Project for the awesome Chingu Cohorts!<br />
Here we try to recrate a complete copy of the cool Tickybot-landing page  <br />
which was also build in the Chingu Cohort as part of Voyage 2. <br />
If we have time, we will also try to give it an own personal spin.

## Links
here is the original Tickybot Landing Page: https://tickybott.herokuapp.com/ <br />
here is our clone version: https://chingu-voyage3.github.io/toucans-19/

## Documentation
We are currently using html and vanilla css & javascript. <br />
As this is a learning project we would like to stick as close to <br />
the programming language as possible and really get the basics of our craft. <br />
The ongoing development will further be documentet in act (and steps if its necessery).

### Act I
The first act was to assemble the group and start the github repository, <br />
and of course deciding on a project. As the project manager https://github.com/Alexever17 was chosen. <br />
This was stage was finished roughly on 03.12.2017

### Act II
The first coding step in our journey will be a mockup of a static version of the Tickybot Landing Page. <br />
For that the website wassplit in multiple area which were assigned between different teammembers. <br />
Currently in this phases
