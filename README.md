## Introdcution
Hy there stranger and welcome in our small learning Project for the awesome Chingu Cohorts!
Here we try to recrate a complete copy of the cool Tickybot-landing page which
was also build in the Chingu Cohort as part of Voyage 2.
If we have time, we will also try to give it an own personal spin

## Links
here is the original Tickybot Landing Page: https://tickybott.herokuapp.com/
here is our clone version: https://chingu-voyage3.github.io/toucans-19/

## Documentation
We are currently using html and vanilla css & javascript.
As this is a learning project we would like to stick as close to the programming
language as possible and really get the basics of our craft.
The ongoing development will further be documentet in act (and steps if its necessery)

### Act I
The first act was to assemble the group and start the github repository,
and of course deciding on a project. As the project manager https://github.com/Alexever17 was chosen
This was stage was finished roughly on 03.12.2017

### Act II
The first coding step in our journey will be a mockup of a static version of the Tickybot Landing Page
For that the website wassplit in multiple area which were assigned between different teammembers.
Currently in this phases
